          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. It is not visible on the page.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. e.g. space aroud an image.</li>
          <li>* : this is universal for ALL of the elements on the page that have style properties connected to this command.</li>
          <li>Do not repeat yourself(DRY): Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li> A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code: var x = 0;</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code: x < shapes.length;</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code: x++</li>
