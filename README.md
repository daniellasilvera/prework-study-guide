Bootcamp pre-work. study guide for me
# <Daniella's Pre-work>

## Description

I really want to deepen my knowledge further on all aspects of web development, in my current job i am an email campaign executive and we use HTML and CSS i have a very basic understanding of coding and wanted to grow this more. 

I learnt how to code using sematics in HTML and the importance of using elements to create a cleaner code and segment your code so it is recognised by the seo. In additon to how to connect a style sheet in CSS to the HTML file. I also learnt how to code in Javascript understanding the difference between certain commands and the importance of inputing the right commands as well as how to debug when an error occurs. 

I built this project in order to provide a deeper understanding of coding in a practical setting and really utilising what ive learnt in the course for this.
